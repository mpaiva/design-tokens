# design-tokens

A simple repository to share my design tokens concepts with UX communities.

## What can you do here?

Three things:

- **Manage Tokens** - In the [build-tokens folder](/build-tokens/) you can use a Node script to manage and build design tokens JSON files,
- **Use Tokens** - Check out the [public-tokens folder](/public-tokens/) and try importing one of my JSON files into your Token Studio plugin.

- **Provide Feedback** - if you have any questions or suggestions, please leave your feedback on the [issues page](https://github.com/mpaiva/design-tokens/issues/new/choose).
